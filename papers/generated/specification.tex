\subsection{1. Introduction}\label{introduction}}

This document describes the Wamu protocol which augments a
state-of-the-art non-interactive threshold signature scheme
(e.g.~CGGMP20 {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-cggmp20}{1}{]}) by
cryptographically associating each signing party with a decentralized
identity. This is achieved by:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Splitting the secret share for each party between the party and the
  output of a signing operation by its associated decentralized identity
  thus making the signing operation a requirement for reconstructing the
  party's secret share.
\item
  Adding peer-to-peer decentralized identity verification to the key
  generation and signing protocols (and optionally to the key refresh
  protocol) of the threshold signature scheme.
\item
  Defining protocols for identity rotation, share addition and removal,
  threshold modification and share recovery that build on top of the
  above 2 augmentations.
\end{itemize}

Wamu is designed to operate in a decentralized, trust-minimized and
asynchronous setting with:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  no centralized or trust-based identity infrastructure.
\item
  signing parties being mainstream consumer devices communicating
  asynchronously.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{NOTE:} For interoperability with existing wallet solutions, the
only requirement for decentralized identity providers is the ability to
compute cryptographic signatures for any arbitrary message in such a way
that the output signature can be verified in a non-interactive manner.

\hypertarget{preliminaries}{%
\subsection{2. Preliminaries}\label{preliminaries}}

The rest of this document describes the Wamu protocol in technical
detail. For these descriptions, we'll use the following notation:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(P\) denotes a party.
\item
  \(I\) denotes a decentralized identity.
\item
  \(pk\) denotes the address (or public key) of a decentralized
  identity.
\item
  \(sk\) denotes the secret key of a decentralized identity.
\item
  \(KeyGen\) denotes a key generation algorithm.
\item
  \(Sig\) denotes a signing algorithm.
\item
  \(Ver\) denotes a signature verification algorithm.
\item
  \(S\) denotes the set of verified decentralized identities for all
  signatories.
\item
  \(q\) denotes the prime order of cyclic group of the elliptic curve.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{NOTE:} While the augmenting protocols in this document are
described in relation to the current (circa. 2023) state-of-the-art
CGGMP20 {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-cggmp20}{1}{]} non-interactive
threshold signature scheme for ECDSA signatures, Wamu is a generic
protocol that can be adapted to any non-interactive threshold signature
scheme (e.g.~GG20 {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-gg20}{2}{]} and CMP20
{[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-cmp20}{3}{]}) that allows for asynchronous
communication between signing parties.

\hypertarget{share-splitting-and-reconstruction}{%
\subsection{3. Share Splitting and
Reconstruction}\label{share-splitting-and-reconstruction}}

Given a secret share \(x\) for a party \(P\) with an associated
decentralized identity \(I\), the share splitting and reconstruction
protocol describes how to split \(x\) between \(P\) and the output of a
signing operation \(Sig\) by \(I\) so that the output of \(Sig\) is
required to reconstruct the secret share \(x\).

This is achieved by generating a message \(m\) (we'll refer to this
message as the ``signing share'') and computing a ``sub-share''
\(\beta\) (i.e a share of the secret share \(x\)) in such a way that
\(m\) needs to be signed by \(I\) using \(Sig\) to produce another
``sub-share'' \(\alpha\), such that \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are shares
of \(x\) under Shamir's secret-sharing scheme
{[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-sss79}{4}{]}.

\textbf{NOTE:} Share splitting and reconstruction is a single-party
localized concern that happens after (and is not related to) the
distributed key generation (DKG) protocol of the threshold signature
scheme.

\hypertarget{share-splitting}{%
\subsubsection{3.1. Share splitting}\label{share-splitting}}

Given a secret share \(x\) as input and access to the decentralized
identity \(I\) with secret key \(sk\), the share splitting protocol
proceeds as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Sample a random message \(m\) (i.e.~the signing share).
\item
  Compute a signature \((r, s) = Sig(sk, m)\).
\item
  Compute the first sub-share of \(x\) as the point
  \(\alpha = (r, s \bmod q)\).
\item
  Generate a line \(L\) (i.e a polynomial of degree 1) such that
  \(\alpha\) is a point on the line and \(x\) is the constant term
  (i.e.~Polynomial Interpolation
  {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-wiki:interpolation}{5}{]})
\item
  Compute another point \(\beta\) from \(L\) such that
  \(\beta \neq \alpha\), \(\beta\) becomes the second sub-share of
  \(x\).
\item
  Erase both \(\alpha\) and \(L\) from memory.
\item
  Return the signing share \(m\) and the sub-share \(\beta\).
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{share-reconstruction}{%
\subsubsection{3.2. Share reconstruction}\label{share-reconstruction}}

Given a signing share \(m\) and a sub-share \(\beta\) as input (i.e.~the
outputs of the share splitting protocol in
\protect\hyperlink{share-splitting}{section 3.1}) and access to the
decentralized identity \(I\) with secret key \(sk\), the share
reconstruction protocol proceeds as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Compute a signature \((r, s) = Sig(sk, m)\).
\item
  Compute a sub-share \(\alpha\) as the point
  \(\alpha = (r, s \bmod q)\).
\item
  Generate the line \(L\) by performing Polynomial Interpolation
  {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-wiki:interpolation}{5}{]} using \(\alpha\)
  and \(\beta\) as inputs.
\item
  Compute \(x\) as the constant term of \(L\).
\item
  Erase both \(\alpha\) and \(L\) from memory.
\item
  Return \(x\) as the secret share.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{NOTE:} For ECDSA signatures, the value of the parameter \(s\) in
\((r, s) = Sig(sk, m)\) is already computed modulo \(q\). We use the
notation \(\alpha = (r, s \bmod q)\) for the sub-share to make it clear
(at a glance) that the sub-shares are computed using finite field
arithmetic.

  \end{itemize}
\item
  At the beginning of Round 2, verify \(\varphi _j\) from all \(P_j\) by

  report the culprit and halt.
\item
  After the Output phase, follow the share splitting protocol in
  \protect\hyperlink{share-splitting}{section 3.1} to split secret share

  \end{itemize}
\item
  At the beginning of the Output phase, verify \(\varphi _j\) from all
  \(P_j\) as follows:

  \begin{itemize}

  \item
    Verify that \(pk_i \in S_j\) or report the culprit and halt.
  \item
    Verify \(\varphi _i\) by checking that the output of
    \(Ver(pk_i, m, \varphi _i)\) is valid or report the culprit and
    halt.

shares with the following modifications:

  to split \(x_i^\ast\) into a new signing share \(m_i^\ast\) and a
  sub-share \(\beta _i^\ast\) for each party \(P_i\).

\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{share-addition-and-removal}{%
\subsection{10. Share Addition and
Removal}\label{share-addition-and-removal}}

Share addition and removal allows a quorum of verified parties to either
issue a secret share to a new party and its associated decentralized
identity, or revoke the secret share of any party respectively.

\hypertarget{share-addition}{%
\subsubsection{10.1. Share Addition}\label{share-addition}}

Share addition for a new party \(P_i\) with associated decentralized
identity \(I_i\) proceeds as follows:

\begin{enumerate}

\item
  For all \(P_j\) where \(j \neq i\), initiate an identity challenge for
  \(P_i\) by following the protocol in

\item
  For \(P_i\), respond to the identity challenge by following the

\item
  For all \(P_j\) where \(j \neq i\), verify the identity challenge
  response from \(P_i\) by following the protocol in

\item
  Follow the key refresh protocol described in
  \protect\hyperlink{key-refresh}{section 6} with \(P_i\) included as
  participant if the identity challenge above is passed.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{share-removal}{%
\subsubsection{10.2. Share Removal}\label{share-removal}}

Share removal for a party \(P_i\) with associated decentralized identity
\(I_i\) proceeds as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Follow the key refresh protocol described in
  \protect\hyperlink{key-refresh}{section 6} without \(P_i\).
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{threshold-modification}{%
\subsection{11. Threshold Modification}\label{threshold-modification}}

Threshold modification allows a quorum of verified parties to change the
threshold (i.e.~change the size of the quorum).

While threshold modification (and more generally \(t\)-out-of-\(n\)
sharing, specifically the case where \(n > t+1\)) is not formally
specified in CGGMP20 {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-cggmp20}{1}{]}, it can be
derived in a relatively straightforward manner based on GG18
{[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-gg18}{6}{]} (and GG20
{[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-gg20}{2}{]}) which CGGMP20
{[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-cggmp20}{1}{]} builds upon (see sections
1.2.8, 1.2.1 and 1.2.2 of CGGMP20
{[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-cggmp20}{1}{]}). In general, CGGMP20
{[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-cggmp20}{1}{]} can be seen as a combination of
CMP20 {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-cmp20}{3}{]} and GG20
{[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-gg20}{2}{]}, and a direct improvement on GG18
{[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-gg18}{6}{]}.

Therefore, threshold modification can be achieved by following the key
refresh protocol described in section 3.2 of CGGMP20
{[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-cggmp20}{1}{]} and
\protect\hyperlink{key-refresh}{section 6} of this document, with some
modifications based on the key generation protocols described in GG18
{[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-gg18}{6}{]} and GG20
{[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-gg20}{2}{]}, and following the instructions in
section 1.2.8 of CGGMP20 {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-cggmp20}{1}{]}.

In particular, this is achieved by performing a \(t\)-out-of-\(n\)
Feldman's VSS {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-feldman-vss}{7}{]} sharing of
the values \(x_i\) (as defined in section 3.2 of CGGMP20
{[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-cggmp20}{1}{]}), with the new threshold \(t\)
used as the threshold parameter (similarly defined as \(t\)) for
Feldman's VSS {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-feldman-vss}{7}{]} protocol as
described in section 2.8 and Phase 2 of section 3.1 in GG20
{[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-gg20}{2}{]} (and similary in section 2.6 and
Phase 2 of section 4.1 in GG18 {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-gg18}{6}{]}).

\textbf{NOTE:} Similar modifications can be applied to the signing
protocol described in section 3.1 of CGGMP20
{[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-cggmp20}{1}{]} and
\protect\hyperlink{signing}{section 5} of this document to achieve a
\(t\)-out-of-\(n\) sharing of the secret key for \(n \geq t+1\). This is
achieved by performing a \(t\)-out-of-\(n\) Feldman's VSS
{[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-feldman-vss}{7}{]} sharing of the value
\(x_i\) (as defined in section 3.1 of CGGMP20

\hypertarget{share-recovery}{%
\subsection{12. Share Recovery}\label{share-recovery}}

Share recovery is only possible if the user's decentralized identity
either survived or can be recovered after the disastrous event. In
either case, there are two options for share recovery depending on:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A quorum of honest parties surviving the disastrous event.
\item
  A backup (preferably encrypted) of a signing share \(m\) and sub-share
  \(\beta\) pair on user-controlled secondary or device-independent
  storage.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{share-recovery-quorum}{%
\subsubsection{12.1. Share recovery with a surviving quorum of honest
parties}\label{share-recovery-quorum}}

If a quorum of honest parties survives the disastrous event, share
recovery can be accomplished based on peer-to-peer decentralized
identity verification.

Share recovery for a party \(P_i\) with associated decentralized
identity \(I_i\) with address \(pk_i\) and secret key \(sk_i\) proceeds
as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  For \(P_i\), Initiate a ``share-recovery'' request by following the
  protocol in
  \protect\hyperlink{identity-authed-request-initiation}{section 7.1}.
\item
  For all \(P_j\) where \(j \neq i\):

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Verify the ``share-recovery'' request by following the protocol in
    \protect\hyperlink{identity-authed-request-verification}{section
    7.2}.
  \item
    Initiate an identity challenge for \(P_i\) by following the protocol
    in \protect\hyperlink{identity-challenge-initiation}{section 8.1}.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  For \(P_i\), respond to the identity challenge by following the
  protocol in \protect\hyperlink{identity-challenge-response}{section
  8.2}.
\item
  For all \(P_j\) where \(j \neq i\), verify the identity challenge
  response from \(P_i\) by following the protocol in
  \protect\hyperlink{identity-challenge-verification}{section 8.3}.
\item
  Follow the key refresh protocol described in
  \protect\hyperlink{key-refresh}{section 6} if all verifications above
  pass.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{share-recovery-backup}{%
\subsubsection{12.2. Share recovery with a backup on user-controlled
secondary or device-independent storage}\label{share-recovery-backup}}

\hypertarget{share-recovery-backup-overview}{%
\paragraph{12.2.1. Overview of share recovery with
backup}\label{share-recovery-backup-overview}}

From the share splitting and reconstruction protocol in
\protect\hyperlink{share-splitting-and-reconstruction}{section 3}, we
note that for any party \(P\), the combination of a signing share \(m\)
and a sub-share \(\beta\) alone is insufficient to reconstruct the
secret share \(x\). This is because a signature of \(m\) from the
decentralized identity \(I\) is required to compute the sub-share
\(\alpha\), so that \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) can then be used to
reconstruct \(L\) and compute the secret share \(x\) as the constant
term of \(L\).

Therefore, a signing share \(m\) and sub-share \(\beta\) pair can be
safely backed up to user-controlled secondary (e.g.~a secondary device
or a flash drive) or device-independent storage (e.g.~Apple iCloud
\footnote{Apple iCloud. \url{https://www.icloud.com}.}, Google Drive
\footnote{Google Drive. \url{https://drive.google.com}.}, Microsoft
OneDrive \footnote{Microsoft OneDrive.
  \url{https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/onedrive/online-cloud-storage}.},
Dropbox \footnote{Dropbox. \url{https://www.dropbox.com}.} e.t.c)
without exposing the secret share.

\hypertarget{share-recovery-backup-encrypt}{%
\paragraph{12.2.2. Generating an encrypted backup for share
recovery}\label{share-recovery-backup-encrypt}}

For increased security, a signature of a standardized phrase can be used
as entropy for generating an encryption secret which can then be used to
encrypt the signing share \(m\) and the sub-share \(\beta\) using a
symmetric encryption algorithm before saving them to back up storage.

Given a standardized phase \(k\), a key derivation function \(H\), a
symmetric encryption algorithm \(E\), this would proceed as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Compute the signature \(\phi = Sig(sk, k)\).
\item
  Generate the encryption secret \(\varepsilon = H(\phi)\).
\item
  Compute the ciphertext for the signing share \(m\) as
  \(m_c = E_{enc}(m, \varepsilon)\).
\item
  Compute the ciphertext for the sub-share \(\beta\) as
  \(\beta _c = E_{enc}(\beta, \varepsilon)\).
\item
  Erase both \(\phi\) and \(\varepsilon\) from memory.
\item
  Save \(m_c\) and \(\beta _c\) to backup storage.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{share-recovery-backup-decrypted}{%
\paragraph{12.2.3. Decrypting an encrypted
backup}\label{share-recovery-backup-decrypted}}

Share recovery would then start by signing this standardized phrase,
using the signature to recreate the encryption secret and then
decrypting the encrypted backup to retrieve the signing share \(m\) and
the sub-share \(\beta\).

Given a standardized phase \(k\), a key derivation function \(H\), a
symmetric encryption algorithm \(E\), the ciphertexts for the signing
share \(m_c\) and the ciphertext for the sub-share \(\beta _c\), this
would proceed as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Compute the signature \(\phi = Sig(sk, k)\).
\item
  Generate the encryption secret \(\varepsilon = H(\phi)\).
\item
  Compute the signing share \(m = E_{dec}(m_c, \varepsilon)\).
\item
  Compute the sub-share \(\beta = E_{dec}(\beta _c, \varepsilon)\).
\item
  Erase both \(\phi\) and \(\varepsilon\) from memory.
\item
  Return the signing share \(m\) and the sub-share \(\beta\).
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{share-recovery-backup-enhancements}{%
\paragraph{12.2.4. Further security and usability considerations for
share recovery}\label{share-recovery-backup-enhancements}}

For further improved security and usability, the signing share \(m\) can
be prefixed with a custom message that alerts the user to the purpose of
the signature. This can help reduce the effectiveness of an adversary
that gains access to the backup and tries to trick the user into signing
\(m\).

Additionally, it's possible to rerun the share splitting protocol to
generate a new pair of a signing share \(m^ \ast\) and a sub-share
\(\beta ^ \ast\) such that \(m^ \ast \neq m\),
\(\beta ^ \ast \neq \beta\) and \(L^ \ast \neq L\) to be specifically
used for backup and recovery. This gives us the option to have separate
signing shares for backup and recovery with customized prefixes that
make it clear to the user that they're signing a backup signing share.

Lastly, the backup signing share \(m^ \ast\) can be generated based on
user input (e.g.~a passphrase or security questions) removing the need
for it to be backed up together with a sub-share \(\beta ^ \ast\) but
instead relying on the user to provide this input during recovery as a
security-usability tradeoff.
